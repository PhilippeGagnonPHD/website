Alexandre Bouchard-Côté (UBC), Trevor Campbell (UBC), Liangliang Wang (SFU) and I obtained a Collaborative Research Team (CRT) CANSSI [grant](https://canssi.ca/story/crt-27/). The budget is 148,000$ per annum for three years, essentially dedicated to the funding of world-class Ph.D. students to assist us in the research project.
