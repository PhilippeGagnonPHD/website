I am an associate professor in the [Department of Mathematics and Statistics](https://dms.umontreal.ca/en/){:target="_blank"} of Université de Montréal. From December 2019 to June 2025, I was an assistant professor in the same department. From October 2017 to October 2019, I was a postdoctoral researcher at University of Oxford, working with [Arnaud Doucet](http://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/~doucet/){:target="_blank"} on [non-reversible jump algorithms](https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.01340){:target="_blank"}. 

I have a background in statistics (my MSc and PhD are in statistics). I also have a certain background in actuarial science (I have a BSc in actuarial science and I am Associate of the [Society of Actuaries](https://www.soa.org){:target="_blank"}). My research interests are:
* Bayesian inference,
	* in particular, robust inference in the presence of outliers, 
* computational statistics,
	* in particular, Markov chain Monte Carlo methods.

I also have an interest for the application of the methodology I develop in actuarial science. For a list of my preprints and publications, please see the [research](https://philippegagnonphd.github.io/website/research/) section of my website.

**Advertisement:** I am always looking for students with a strong background in either: theoretical statistics, applied statistics and actuarial science, or computer science (to develop R or Python packages for a user-friendly and efficient implementation of the developed methods). There exist multiple funding opportunities. In particular, I obtained grants that are dedicated to the funding of world-class MSc and PhD students, and postdoctoral researchers (see [News](https://philippegagnonphd.github.io/website/news/) for more details about the grants). Also, prospective students and postdocs can apply for scholarships such as [NSERC](http://www.nserc-crsng.gc.ca/){:target="_blank"} and [FRQNT](http://www.frqnt.gouv.qc.ca/en/accueil){:target="_blank"}. Please do not hesitate to contact me if you are interested in my research. *I aim to provide an environment to my students that is equitable, inclusive and diversified. In particular, recruiting will be done according to Université de Montréal's Equity, Diversity and Inclusion policy.*
